Thanks for visiting my site! My name is Alexis Coupe, and this is my weblog about various technical subjects and the occasional personal topic.

### Personal Information

I'm french and have been living with my partner in Australia for 2 years now. When I'm not working or spending time geeking around, I'm enjoying photography, playing tennis, etc. and going out with my friends.

### Why this blog ?

I have just started this blog in September 2016 with several goals in mind:

- Share my experience and perspectives on threat intelligence, threat hunting, vulnerabilities, malware analysis and all kind of security subjects
- Share tricks, tips and cheat sheets on stuff that I have spent time for nothing ...
- Explore and develop my knowledge
- Engage with the community
- Learn, learn and learn

### Professional Information

I have been in the cyber security field for 5 years. 

I have had a primary focus on Penetration Testing which has taught me the other side of the iceberg â€“ The threat actor mindset. 

I also worked as a Cyber Analyst - My mission was to guide and ensure efficient and effective monitoring services - handle continual improvements in order to identify new threats - deal with security investigations.

I'm currently working as Cyber Defense Investigator - hunting bad guys, improve the threat intelligence and dealing with investigation is part of my day to day basis ...
